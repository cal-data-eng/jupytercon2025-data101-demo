    "In previous projects, we used an extension called JupySQL to run SQL directly in your Jupyter notebook. However, this can cause the notebook to be very long, and it also introduces unnecessary complexity when running the autograder. Starting with this project, we will be moving to a new query execution workflow where you will write your SQL queries in separate `.sql` files under the `queries` directory. It goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read and understand the question\n",
    "2. Open the `.sql` file that corresponds to that question. For example, for Q1b, you should open `queries/1b.sql`\n",
    "3. Write your SQL code in that file. **If there is starter code, make sure you do NOT delete any of it otherwise the autograder will fail!**\n",
    "4. **Save your SQL file.** This is ***SUPER IMPORTANT*** so that when you test your query result, it is running your most recent query.\n",
    "5. Go back to your project Jupyter notebook, and run the cell that contains the call to `grading_util.run_file`. It will look something like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result_1b = grading_util.run_file(\"1b\")\n",
    "result_1b\n",
    "```\n",
    "6. Observe the output and run tests\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run one-off SQL queries (for example to explore the database), you can do that using `grading_util.run_sql` like so:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "grading_util.run_sql(\"SELECT 'YOUR CODE HERE';\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "7. Once you're done with the project, upload your `queries.zip` file (instead of `results.zip`). This file will be automatically created when you run `grading_util.prepare_submission_and_cleanup()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dos and Don'ts**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you encounter an error, **read the entire error message** before asking for help - it might be long, but it can be helpful! For example, if you have a syntax error in your SQL code, it should tell you which line it occurred on and where on that line it occurred.\n",
    "- You may find it useful to use **JupyterHub's split screen feature** so you can have the notebook and SQL file side by side. You can use this by dragging the tabs at the top. You can either do a left/right split or top/bottom split.\n",
    "- If you need to run a SQL statement that spans multiple lines, **use Python's multiline strings** which are enclosed in triple quotes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "grading_util.run_sql(\"\"\"\n",
    "SELECT 'YOUR CODE HERE';\n",
    "SELECT 'YOUR CODE HERE';\n",
    "SELECT 'YOUR CODE HERE';\n",
    "\"\"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Make sure to **terminate all SQL statements with a semicolon** and **enclose all subqueries in parentheses**.\n",
    "- You can run multiple statements within a file or within a single `run_sql` call. **The results of each statement will be returned in a list; you may index into the list to view the results of an individual statement.** If no rows are outputted by that statement, `None` will be returned (instead of a `pandas.DataFrame`)\n",

Each week, they publish “charts” which aggregate the total sales, streams (e.g. via Spotify, Apple Music, or YouTube) as well as radio airplay in the US.\n",
    " \n",
    "The most (in)famous chart is the [Billboard Hot 100](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/), widely regarded as the list of most popular songs in the US. For this assignment, you’ll be looking at data from the Hot 100 list, primarily in recent years — though the database we’ve provided to you goes all the way back to 1958! \n",

    "\n",
    "Why might we make our own SQL database of something that’s already available on a webpage? Well, we write queries and learn things about music or pop history that might be harder from just looking at a chart. But perhaps an alternate reason is that the Billboard website loads hundreds of data trackers, and dozens of megabytes of data on every webpage. Sometimes, it’s nicer to just view data... in a database. 🙃\n",
